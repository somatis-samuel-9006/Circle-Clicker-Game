DESIGN:
This game is my own varient of an aimbooster-style flash game. It is meant to be used as a simple mouse clicking excercise. Circles continually
appear on the screen, and the objective of the player is to simply click as many as they can before each one disappears. This game uses html
for basic structure, CSS for visuals, and Javascript for all gameplay elements. It also comes with some server-side hosting capabilities, but
they aren't needed to simply play the game.

TESTING:
The page was continually reloaded/rehosted after every change to ensure everything was working properly. Inspecting the console and sources
was another technique used.

REFLECTION:
Overall, this was a fun and interesting project to make. If I had more time to dedicate to it, I would have liked to add more features to it, such
as a start screen, levels, and maybe a boss battle of some kind. Creating elements dynamically with JS was a bit challenging, but the most
challenging part of this project was still the server-side scripting. However, I feel like my main source of difficulty with server-side code is just
the abundance of unfamiliar syntax, which will be familiar to me in time.
